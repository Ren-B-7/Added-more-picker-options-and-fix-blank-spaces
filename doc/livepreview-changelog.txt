==============================================================================
v0.9                                           *livepreview-changelog-v0.9*


BREAKING CHANGES

Configuration no longer handles the `opts.cmd` option. The user command used by
live-preview.nvim is always `LivePreview`.

BUG FIXES

- Files with spaces in their paths don't work properly #254 
  <https://github.com/brianhuster/live-preview.nvim/issues/254>

NEW FEATURES

- Supports `svg` files.

==============================================================================
v0.8                                           *livepreview-changelog-v0.8*


BREAKING CHANGES

- Now the plugin has only one command `opts.cmd` (default: `LivePreview`)
  instead of two (`opts.commands.start` and `opts.commands.stop`).
- The command `opts.cmd` has 4 subcommands: `start`, `close`, `pick`, and
  `help`.
- Takes `opts.cmd = "LivePreview"` as example, to compare with the previous
  version:
    - `:LivePreview start` is equivalent to previous `opts.commands.start`
      (default to `:LivePreview`) of previous version.
    - `:StopPreview close` is equivalent to `opts.commands.stop` (default to
      `:StopPreview`) of previous version.
- `:Telescope livepreview` is removed. Use `:LivePreview pick` instead.


NEW FEATURES

- New configuration options:
    - `opts.picker`: Picker to use for opening files. 3 choices are available:
      `telescope`, `fzf-lua`, `mini.pick`. If `nil`, the plugin look for the first
      available picker when you call the `pick` command.
- `LivePreview pick`: Open a picker and select a file to preview. This command
  works with the pickers `telescope`, `fzf-lua`, and `mini.pick`, as specified in
  `opts.picker`. If `opts.picker` is `nil`, the plugin will look for the first
  available picker when you call the `pick` command.
- `LivePreview help`: Show document about each subcommand.


==============================================================================

NEW FEATURES                         *livepreview-changelog-v0.7-new-features*

==============================================================================
v0.6                                           	*livepreview-changelog-v0.6*


1. FIX BUG

- Fix bug with `dynamic_root = true` option not working #211
  <https://github.com/brianhuster/live-preview.nvim/issues/211>

2. NEW FEATURES

üîç INTEGRATION WITH TELESCOPE.NVIM ~

To use this feature, make sure you have installed nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>

Then, set `telescope.autoload` to `true` in the configuration table
<./README.md#setup> of live-preview.nvim. It will automatically load the
`Telescope livepreview` extension when the plugin is set up.

Alternatively, you can load the extension in your Neovim configuration file:

>lua
    require('telescope').load_extension('livepreview')
<

Now you can run `:Telescope livepreview` to open live-preview.nvim‚Äôs
Telescope picker.


‚öôÔ∏è NEW CONFIGURATION OPTIONS ~

`autokill` (default: `false` or `v:false`): If true, the plugin will
automatically kill other processes running on the same port (except for Neovim)
when starting the server.


FILE PATH AS OPTIONAL ARGUMENT FOR THE COMMAND TO START SERVER ~

You can now pass a file path as an argument to the command `:LivePreview` (or
whatever you configure) to open that file in the browser. For example,
`:LivePreview Documents/file.md`.


AVAILABILITY ON LUAROCKS ü™® ~

Now you can use rocks.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim> to
install live-preview.nvim with a single command:

>vim
    :Rocks install live-preview.nvim
<
